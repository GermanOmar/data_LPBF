# Laser powder bed fusion dataset for relative density prediction of commercial metallic alloys
This repository contains the dataset and code for predicting relative density of metallic alloys produced by L-PBF.

# Dataset
The dataset comprises 1,579 observations, and it is organized in such a way that the first ten columns are the inputs (i.e., printing conditions, material, shielding gas, printed geometry, etc.), and the last column is the relative density expressed in percent. The dataset is provided in Excel format in the Harvard Dataverse repository: La FÃ©-Perdomo, I., Barrionuevo, G. O. & Ramos-Grez, J. A.
